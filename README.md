# Analysis_of_world's_oldest_businesses
An essential part of business is planning for the future and ensuring the company survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this really well and last for hundreds of years.

This notebook provides an analysis of the world's oldest businesses from data supplied by BusinessFinancing.co.uk. I use PostgreSQL to write queries that would help solve various questions such as:
*  What is the range of the founding years throughout the world?
*  How many businesses were founded before 1000?
*  Oldest business by continent
